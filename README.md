this project is about building the map that stores planting projects and actions done by CGM : 

It can be used by other organizations, to organize their actions and plans and map them, it is implemented in order to make it easier to map projects with a location on a map. 

- storage of projects
- projects with location on map 
-  can add a project in database and put it in the map

    Will build it with leaflt JS
